It’s felt like a long time coming and I’m excited to finally start posting.</p><p>I thought before I actually started posting iOS content, it would be worth uploading a post about the site itself and how to use it. I’ve probably spent around 30 hours on this site so far, just working to make the user experience as good as it can be. Whether it’s reading the actual posts, looking at my home page or even reading my about page, I want this site to be as simple to navigate as possible 🧭.</p><h2>Homepage Sections</h2><p>When it comes to finding the latest content to read, or content you might find interesting, the homepage is the place to be. I’ve spent time adding features such as latest/recent articles sections which you can already see working on the homepage now, in fact this is probably how you opened this article in the first place!. More of these sections will appear as more content is added to the site. For example: Latest SwiftUI Article &amp; Latest Latest UIKIt Article. I’m hoping to add more and more to the homepage to make it the hub of the entire site.</p><img src="../../images/articles/welcome/latest-article.png" alt="Latest Article Section"/><h2>Filtering</h2><p>When it comes to filtering content, the tags are a good place to start. I’ve added a range of tags so far to the site which will hopefully cater for all different types of content that I post. This should enable you to use them to find exactly what interests you. By clicking on a tag you will be presented with a page showing you all articles with that tag, you can use this to find the next article to read 📄.</p><img src="../../images/articles/welcome/tag-filtering.png" alt="Tag Filtering"/><h2>Reading Articles</h2><p>Once you are in an article, like you are now, you should see a few key details. The title, a share button, the date the post was published to the site and then also the estimated read time. The share button will actually share the current post you are reading to Twitter/X and will actually tag me to let me know you’ve enjoyed the article 😃.</p><img src="../../images/articles/welcome/share.png" alt="Tag Filtering"/><h2>Wrap Up</h2><p>That pretty much wraps up the site in its current state. It’s pretty simple but I hope to build on it a lot in the future. I hope to get some more content up soon and hopefully start sharing some cool stuff.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
