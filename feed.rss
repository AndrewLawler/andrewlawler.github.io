For the second year running the conference has been held at the Playhouse in Leeds and has been home to over 300 iOS Devâ€™s for days of amazing talks, workshops (new for this year) and lotâ€™s of great conversations. Having been such a success in the first two years, Swift Leeds has expanded to now be a 2 day conference with even more developers than previous years attending.</p><p>Having attended the conference since itâ€™s first year, Iâ€™m usually always eager to get to October to get back to the conference to listen to some amazing talks. This year was no different, with the amazing lineup of speakers I was really looking forward to learning some new things.</p><p>After making the journey to Leeds on the Monday I arrived at the conference in time to get myself some breakfast and a well needed coffee (I needed the energy after the 5am alarm and train ðŸ’€). After eating I was straight into the theatre ready to hear the first talk.</p><h2>Day One</h2><p>The first talk on day one was from <strong>Richie Flores</strong>. His talk was heavily focused on UX and what different apps do to give their users a specific feeling. He gave examples of different apps and how they use layouts and UX to really encourage different behaviours from their users. I really enjoyed this talk because UI/UX is always something that has been really interesting to me. I actually did graphic design in school way before I ever programmed for the first time so seeing the thought process behind different design choices is always fascinating to me. Really great talk.</p><img src="../../images/articles/swift-leeds-2023/richie-talk.jpg" alt="richie flores talk" /><p>The second talk was by <strong>TundsDev.</strong> Having watched a lot of Tundeâ€™s videos while I was actually learning about iOS, I was really excited to see his talk, especially when I saw the topic was about StoreKit. Having worked in codebases with StoreKit implemented in the past, I know how much of a nightmare it can me, Tundeâ€™s talk outlined a simple approach to implement in app purchases into any app, it was a great talk which showed something that is often perceived as really difficult, in an easy way. Really enjoyed it and will 100% be using some of the advice when I come to implementing in app purchases in my own apps. Also, his usages of memes was 10/10.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
